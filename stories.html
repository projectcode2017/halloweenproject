              I collected this story from an English Storyteller from
              London
              Once upon a time, a long time ago, a story was told
              about a postman who had to deliver mail to a lighthouse.
              The lighthouse in this strange story stood tall on a small
              island surrounded by the sea.
              Once a year the ocean tide was so low that one could
              peddle a bicycle as fast as possible, across a low causeway
              to the lighthouse while the tide changed. The visitor had to
              spend the night and catch the next turning of the low tide
              12 hours later exactly or spend the year at the lighthouse
              with the lighthouse keeper. Boats could not land at this
              lighthouse and food was transferred by a boatswain's rigging
              line from the supply boat to the lighthouse keeper.
              *****
              This was an exciting day for the people of the village.
              When the postman arrived on his bicycle with all of the
              years mail. Which also included small packages of cookies
              and candy for the lighthouse keeper. All stored in a huge
              bag on his back and a second huge bag in the basket sitting
              on the front wheel of his bicycle.
              Everybody watched the sea and when the tide touched
              the "get ready marker" the whole village started counting
              down "10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1" and the postman started
              pedaling his bicycle out between the waves as fast as
              he could. Just as he reached the island the waves came
              crashing in over the causeway.
              The postman next slowly climbed up the 234 circular
              lighthouse stairs to the top where the lighthouse keeper
              lived.

              That evening, after a quiet dinner, Jack sat down at his desk to work. He was reading a book about lighthouses when a strange feeling came over him. He felt very cold. Jack shivered as he turned the pages.

Then in the corner, Jack saw the shadow again. This time, Jack was sure it was an old man. The shadow paced back and forth in the room. Jack could tell the man was sad and restless.

Jack looked around the room. He wondered where the shadow was coming from. When he turned around, the shadow was gone.

Jack was very puzzled. He began thinking about the painting. "Could that be why the shadow is here?" he wondered. "Perhaps I have not found the perfect place for it."

Jack went to bed that night thinking about the painting and the ghostly shadows. He tossed and turned throughout the night.

In the early morning, Jack finally fell asleep. He had a dream about the old lighthouse again.

This time, the old man was looking out the window of the lighthouse. He was staring at the sea and watching the gulls dip and dive. The old man looked so happy!

Jack awoke with a start. He knew exactly what he must do.

Jack jumped out of bed and quickly got dressed. He took the painting down and carried it into his living room.

Then he found the perfect place for the painting. It was directly across from his biggest window. Jack loved sitting in front of this window himself. He would watch the waves breaking on the rocks as the sun rose each morning.


JACK MOVED THE PAINTING SO THAT IT FACED THE SEA.
Jack hammered a nail into the wall. Then he carefully hung the painting. He stepped back to see if it was straight. Then he turned around to look at the sea. "Yes!" he exclaimed. "This is definitely the perfect place."

That night, as Jack worked, he waited for the ghostly shadow to appear. But it never did. The shadow did not appear the next night or the night after that.

Jack noticed that a certain sense of peace and calm had come over his house. He stopped dreaming about the old man and the lighthouse, too.

Soon after the strange shadow had disappeared, Jack started working on a new project. He was writing a story about the painting and the ghostly shadow.

Jack decided to start at the beginning. He described how he had found the little house by the sea. He wrote about meeting the old man at the gallery and how he chose the painting of the lighthouse. Then he came to the part about the warning from the owner of the gallery. "I hope you have the perfect place for this painting," he had said.

The old man's comment made Jack wonder. "Did he know all along that the painting was haunted?" Jack thought. "Did he know the painting belonged near the sea?"

Jack decided to take a break from his writing. He got up from his desk and walked over to the painting.

Jack grabbed a cloth and dusted the wooden frame. Then he stopped to look at the picture.

Jack noticed something he had never seen before. A man was standing on the platform of the lighthouse. He was looking out to sea.

"This man looks almost like the shadow," Jack thought.

Then he realized something else. It was the same man from his dreams!

        Jack had been in the Army for nine years and one day
        Jack said to himself "Jack! Jack! I'm tired of being a soldier!"
        So Jack went to his sergeant and said, "Sergeant I'm
        tired of being a soldier I want to get out of the army!"
        "OK Jack we'll let you out tomorrow."
        The next day the army gave Jack a brand new set of
        clothes and a pair of galluses to hold up his britches. (AUDIENCE
        PARTICIPATION) do you know what suspenders
        are? Well the old word is galluses! Say that word. Galluses.
        Some people call them "braces" some call them "suspenders"
        but the old word when they are buttoned on your
        britches is galluses!
        So Jack now had a brand new suit of clothes and the
        Sergeant said, "Here Jack take these two loves of bread!"
        "Sergeant, I don't want to carry no loves of bread! I been
        a soldier for nine years and I'm tired of carrying things!"
        "Jack it"s the rules take these two loves of bread!"
        "Yes sir Sergeant."
        (AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION) Jack saluted the sergeant.
        This is the old way of saluting. Make your hand do a
        circle up to your head and a circle coming back down. Try
        that! OK, back to the story.
        Jack took the two laves of bread and put them up
        under his arm pits to carry them. Jack left the army and
        started walking down the road. He didn't know where he
        was going. Jack's Momma and daddy had died while he
        was in the army.
        Jack had two brothers living over in Blue Ridge, Georgia
        but Jack didn't think much of his brothers and Jack's
        brothers didn't care much for him either. Jack thought he'd
        just walk down the road until he found a town he liked and
        just live there. That makes sense doesn't it? Well it makes
        sense to me!
        Jack was walking along and it was a warm fall day.
        Sweat was running down his face like water down a hill. As
        Jack came around a bend in the road he saw an old man
        standing at a cross road up in front of him. A cross road is
        where two dirt roads cross each other up in the mountains.
        As Jack was passing he tipped his hat and said, "Howdy
        mister. How are you?"
        "Oh I ain't too good Jack"
        "You know my name?"
        "Oh yes Jack everybody knows you."
        "Well you can see from my new clothes I just got out of
        the army today, but what's wrong with you?"
        "Jack, I haven't had any thing to eat in three days.
        Could I have a bite of one of them loaves of bread?"
        "Here Mister take the whole loaf. I'm tired of carrying it.
        Besides it's only getting sweaty here under my arm."
        "Why thank you Jack. Here I got something for you."
        "Mister, I don't want anything. I'll just have to carry it."
        "Oh I'll think you might like this Jack." The old man
        unwrapped a string from around his galluses button and
        handed Jack a sack.
        Jack looked at it and said, "thank you mister that's a
        nice looking sack. Is it used for anything?"
        "Oh yes, Jack! That's a magic sack. You aim it at anything
        you want and slap it on the side three times and say,
        wackity whack whack jump into my sack. What ever you
        aimed it at will jump into your sack."
        "Oh wow, mister. A magic sack like that can be real
        useful. Thank you very much."
        Jack wrapped the sack's string around his galluses
        button and started on walking down the road. That afternoon
        Jack came around another bend in the road and there
        in front of him was another cross road and another old man
        sitting on a stump.
        As Jack walked by he tipped his hat and said, "Howdy,
        mister. How are you doing today?"
        "Howdy to you Jack."
        "You know my name too. Well you can see from my
        new clothes I just got out of the army today and I'm walking
        down this road until I find me a town I like and I'm going to
        live there."
        "Oh ain't that nice Jack. Say Jack! I ain't had nothing to
        eat today could I have bite from that loaf of bred?"
        "Sure mister, take the whole loaf I'm tired of carrying it."
        "Well thank you, Jack. Here I got something in my
        pocket for you." The old man pulled out and handed Jack
        a great big chunk of crystal glass.
        Jack took it. Held it up and looked at it. "My that's a
        fine chunk of crystal glass mister. What do you use it for?"
        "Jack, you soak that crystal in cool spring water and
        look through it and if the death angel is any where around
        you can see the death ang--."
        "I don't want to see no death angel!"
        "You never know when it may come in handy Jack."
        "Yep! That's true mister and I appreciate the gift.
       
        "Yep! That's true mister and I appreciate the gift."

          Hello to Storytellers
          I gift thee this and as was in the olden Sencha Bardic
          days blessed be those who learn the flowing image and tell
          before adding their own souls to the story.
          Bridget Kenny was born, I was told, on one of the Islands
          off the Irish coast towards the close of the last century.
          Which island I don't recall. She lived at the time of this
          story with her mother May Kenny in the home of her Uncle
          Jim Fitspatrick, a Pastor of the local church.
          Bridget as a child was not unlike like any of the other
          Island children with the exception of her reputation of being
          fearless. By the time she was in her teens she had withstood
          so many attempts by the children of her village to
          frighten her they had given up trying to even startle her. And
          this is the story of her strange adventure.
          Bridget was passing her uncle's church on the way
          home when she seen some friends over in the Church's
          graveyard opening a new grave and stopped to visit.
          "Hay Bridg did you come to give us a hand with the
          digging?"</p>
         <p> 
          "Ah no you seem to have plenty of hands and time to
          do your work."
          It was a bit after she had stopped and was chatting
          with her friends when one of the digger's shovel hit a hard
          object. Clearing out the dirt Shawn uncovered a huge leg
          bone and with a grin lifted it up for the others to see.
          "Hay Bridg what do you think?"
          " Pass it up here Shawn and let me hold it." Bridget
          stood there holding the huge leg bone in both hands.
          "Aye this once must have been a huge man."
          "Shawn you need to rebury this'un."
          "We'll do it Bridg, it must have been one of the old
           Fianna warriors" </p>
         <p>
            "But I"ll tell you boys one thing, I, Bridget Kenny, would
          love to kiss a man this big." And with that comment and
          the chuckles from the fellows the leg bone was returned to
           the grave. </p>
         <p>
            That evening after supper, Pastor Jim said, "Bridget
          would you do me a favor and run a short errand. I left
          some papers on the pulpit at the church that I need for the
          sermon I'm working on. Would you mind fetching them for
           me?" </p>
            
          "Yes Uncle I'll be back in a bit." The night was dark, with
          a bit of star and moon light, enough to see by as Bridget
          went up along the path to the church. When she entered
          the sanctuary she lit a bit of a candle she was carrying and
          set it in the holder by the door. Going up to the front she
          found and picked up the papers and turned to leave.
          That is when she noticed a man, a huge man, sitting
          in the last pew, although hardly sitting because by candle
          light he appeared to be barely able to wedge himself into
          the pew. As Bridget came down the isle she said,
          "Good evening to you sir, and how are you?"
          "Well I don’t really know Ms. Bridget. In the light I seem
          to be covered with a bit of dirt and grime and agh my beard
          is badly tangled. But it was a kiss you asked for so I have
          come to oblige you if you wish."
          "Oh my, well thank you sir and why not?" Bridget
          leaned over just a tad and kissed him on the lips.
          "I thank you for your" - but the man was fading from
          sight.
          "Good night!" Bridget picked up the candle, snuffed
          out the flame closed the doors and went home.
          "Here are the papers Uncle."
          "Thank you Bridget and did you have any trouble finding
          them?"
          "Oh no Uncle but I did learn something tonight."
          "And what was that you learned?"
          "I learned that sometimes you get your wishes.

          I give permission to all storytellers to tell this story variant
          and as was in the olden Sencha Bardic days blessed be
          those who learn the story's flowing images and tell in their
          own words before adding their own creations to the story.
          Credit for this variant in my name is not necessary.
          This story is a blend of a couple of Cherokee legends
          from the southern Appalachian Mountains in the USA that
          I collected years ago. This story variant is based on traditional
          stories and my contribution is limited to the structure
          and assimilation of the various flowing images. The story is
          in oral language
          A long time ago before African, Asian and European
          folks lived in the southern Appalachian Mountains of the
          USA the Cherokee and Creek people had a terrible problem
          with two creatures who ate human flesh. Spearfinger
          the wife was a shape shifter. She was able to shape shift to
          look like members of your family or friends.
          Spearfinger could change out of her stone body and
          would turn herself into a bush or a rock or maybe be hiding
          in a tree, looking like a squirrel or a bird. Spearfinger
          would watch your house until someone in your family left
          the house and went on an errand. Spearfinger would then
          shape shift and change to look just like who ever she saw
          leaving your house.
          She would call your name, "Mary honey, come over
          here and let Sister comb your hair." While you were sitting
          on her lap, and thinking spearfinger was your Sister,
          spearfinger would be, maybe, singing to you while she
          was combing your hair. But with her special stone finger,
          old spearfinger would open up your side and without you
          feeling anything she would reach in and steal your liver.
          Spearfinger then with that special finger would close up
          your side. You would not know spearfinger had taken out
          and would eat your liver, oh she loved to eat children's livers.
          Your family would know because without your liver you
          became sick and died a couple of days later.
